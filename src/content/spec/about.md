![alt text](./about.jpg "cyberman")

Hello, my name is maine...

I am a Certified Penetration Tester (CPTS, CompTIA Pentest+) focused on securing applications, networks, and systems by proactively uncovering vulnerabilities through tailored penetration tests, network vulnerability assessments, and Web Application Pentest, identifying risks that automated tools or in-house teams often miss.

My approach is that of grey/black box methodologies to simulate real-world attack scenarios—authorized by you—to expose weaknesses before advanced threat actors do. By mirroring adversary tactics, I help businesses fortify defenses, prioritize critical risks, and stay ahead of evolving threats.

It may be worth mentioning my background in Engineering with a Bachelor's degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering, where I developed solution-based projects and managed a team of mechanical and electrical technicians. Skills acquired from project management to technical skills such Electrical Designs, PCB Electronic Design, PLC Programming, to C/assembly working with embedded systems and micro-controller. Though working in information security (cyber security), I enjoy building electronic gadget which is still part of my expertise, the critical thinking from my background was easily transferable to think outside the box in terms of compromising systems.

Welcome to my blog, I hope you enjoy your stay! Feel free to contact me via email or discord :)
