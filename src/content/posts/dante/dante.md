Dante ProLab provides an opportunity to learn common red team methodologies, and gain familiarity with Penetration Testing Concept.

### Scenario

Dante LLC have enlisted your services to audit their network. The company has not undergone a comprehensive penetration test in the past, and want to reduce their technical debt. 

They are concerned that any actual breach could lead to a loss of earnings and reputation damage. Upon breaching the perimeter, you are required to explore the network, moving laterally and vertically, until you gain administrative control over all hosts and reach domain admin. You will level up your skills in information gathering and situational awareness, be able to  exploit Windows and Linux buffer overflows, gain familiarity with the Metasploit Framework, and much else!

This **Red Team Operator Level I** lab will expose players to:

- Enumeration
- Exploit Development
- Lateral Movement
- Privilege Escalation
- Web Application Attacks

### Review

The Lab itself is very straightforward, that’s what was meant by beginner level ProLab, there is no tricks nor complex attach path, most endpoints could be rooted in less that 3 steps.

The value I got from this Lab back then was to practice pivoting for the CPTS, However this time, it was more to test methodologies I had developed to approach networks, and also, i actually wanted to finished the lab this time, not just test my scripts against it.

Host-names and flags are hints, though I wouldn't rely on the flag as it can narrow your vision here.
We know that, in this scenario we are attacking a realistic enterprise network, meaning some user may have access to other endpoints. it is worth spraying credential that you obtain.
