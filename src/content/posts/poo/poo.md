P.O.O PrLab provides an opportunity to learn common red team methodologies, and gain familiarity with Penetration Testing Concept.

### Scenario

Professional Offensive Operations is a rising name in the cyber security world.

Lately they've been working into migrating core services and components to a state of the art cluster which offers cutting edge software and hardware.

P.O.O. is designed to put your skills in enumeration, lateral movement, and privilege escalation to the test within a small Active Directory environment that is configured with the latest operating systems and technologies.

The goal is to compromise the perimeter host, escalate privileges and ultimately compromise the domain while collecting several flags along the way.

Upon completion of this lab, players will have a good understanding of Active Directory attacks and be well versed in the following areas:

- Enumeration
- Active Directory enumeration and attacks
- Lateral movement
- Local privilege escalation
- Situational awareness
- Web application enumeration and attacks

### Review

This Lab covered bit about everything, similar to Dante but on a small scale. The Web Application Exploitation honestly caught me off guard (on the content discovery part), it was something entirely new to me, so a learning experience, and a great experience.
