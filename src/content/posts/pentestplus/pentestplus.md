### Summary

CompTIA PenTest+ validates your ability to identify, mitigate, and report system vulnerabilities. Covering all stages of penetration testing across attack surfaces like cloud, web apps, APIs, and IoT, it emphasizes hands-on skills such as vulnerability management and lateral movement. This certification equips you with the expertise to advance your career as a penetration tester or security consultant.

The Exam consist of 5 different domains as follow:

**Engagement management (13%) Planning and scoping:** defining rules of engagement, testing windows, and target selection. Legal and ethical compliance: ensuring authorization letters, mandatory reporting, and adherence to regulations. Collaboration and communication: aligning with stakeholders through peer reviews, escalation paths, and risk articulation. Penetration test reports: creating reports with executive summaries, findings, and remediation recommendations.

**Reconnaissance and enumeration (21%) Active and passive reconnaissance:** gathering information using open-source intelligence (OSINT), network sniffing, and protocol scanning. Enumeration techniques: performing DNS enumeration, service discovery, and directory enumeration. Reconnaissance tools: using tools like Nmap, Wireshark, and Shodan for information gathering. Script modification: customizing Python, PowerShell, and Bash scripts for reconnaissance and enumeration.

**Vulnerability discovery and analysis (17%) Vulnerability scans:** conducting authenticated, unauthenticated, static application security testing (SAST) and dynamic application security testing (DAST).Result analysis: validating findings, troubleshooting configurations, and identifying false positives. Discovery tools: using tools like Nessus, Nikto, and OpenVAS for vulnerability discovery.

**Attacks and exploits (35%) Network attacks:** performing VLAN hopping, on-path attacks, and service exploitation. Authentication attacks: executing brute-force attacks, pass-the-hash, and credential stuffing. Host-based attacks: conducting privilege escalation, process injection, and credential dumping. Web application attacks: performing SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and directory traversal. Cloud-based attacks: exploiting container escapes, metadata service attacks, and identity and access management (IAM) misconfiguration.AI attacks: explaining prompt injection and model manipulation against artificial intelligence systems.

### Review

The Exam itself is straight forward as it is in the form of multiple choice questions. It tests the candidate on familiarity with Penetration Tools and Methodologies.

If you have some sort of experience in PenTesting/hacking, that exam will be easy for you. Though, I  was not expecting to see code in there, so it would be a good idea to be comfortable with python. Reading and understanding what a PoC written in python is about will be sufficient for this exam.
